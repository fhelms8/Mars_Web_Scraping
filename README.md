## Welcome to my webscraping challenge! 
### In this assignment, I was tasked with building a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and to display the information in a single HTML page.

I felt that this was more difficult than the prior html page building, but after getting passed all of the craziness, I rather enjoyed it. 
##### As always, I welcome feedback. Have a lovely day.
